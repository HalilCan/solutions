# Notes

We as in me across time.

1. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

> Given the `O(log(n+m))` bound, the solution will likely be in the form of divide and conquer. Since we are working with arrays, index-access will be easy time-wise. In that case we can easily access the median of each array and their relative magnitude will tell us the direction in which (relative to the medians) the median of two arrays resides.

> Turns out there's a special case with 2-2 arrays.
